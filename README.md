# Advent-of-Code

## Goals

In this repo I try to solve the **Advent of Code** challenges. I am still learning python and have no experience using git. This repo is mainly used for personal use in expanding these skills.

## Motivation

By working through the daily Advent of Code puzzles, I hope to improve my problem-solving abilities, get more comfortable with Python syntax and logic, and become more familiar with version control using Git and GitHub.

## Structure

Each day of Advent of Code will have its own folder or file. Inside each folder, I will include the solution code, and possibly a notes file where I explain my thought process or document what I learned. If needed, I may also add input files for the puzzle data.

## Learning Focus

- Practicing Python programming

- Understanding Git basics: commits, pushes, branches, etc.

- Writing clean, readable, and reusable code

- Learning how to break down problems and approach them step by step

## *Feedback*
*Suggestions, feedback, or tips are always welcome â€” especially regarding Python best practices or Git usage.*
